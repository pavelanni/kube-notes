.Situation

A question from one of my students: what if I know that my `.kube/config` file
is stolen and I want to deny access to the cluster with my username/token stored in
that file?

I'm still looking for a better solution, but so far here is what I came up with:

. Delete the user:
+
----
$ oc delete user user99
----

. When you try to login as that user you get:
+
----
Authentication required for https://api.cluster-09ec.09ec.ocp4.opentlc.com:6443 (openshift)
Username: user99
Password:
Error from server (InternalError): Internal error occurred: unexpected response: 500
----

. Now you want to recreate that user:
+
----
$ oc create user user99
user.user.openshift.io/user99 created
$ oc get users
NAME          UID                                    FULL NAME   IDENTITIES
opentlc-mgr   f23a2ba1-a877-11e9-aba8-0a580a810032               htpasswd_provider:opentlc-mgr
user26        d3982a7f-a87c-11e9-aba8-0a580a810032               htpasswd_provider:user26
user42        4b8aa833-a87d-11e9-aba8-0a580a810032               htpasswd_provider:user42
user7         21f37541-a88c-11e9-97c1-0a580a820029               htpasswd_provider:user7
user8         1cda3f9c-a898-11e9-aba8-0a580a810032               htpasswd_provider:user8
user99        4a0c5e75-a8c8-11e9-97c1-0a580a820029
----

. So the user is here, but it doesn't have an identity.
That means you can't login with the password you used before.
You can try to create an identity, but you'll get an error:
+
----
$ oc create identity htpasswd_provider:user99
Error from server (AlreadyExists): identities.user.openshift.io "htpasswd_provider:user99" already exists
----

. Which means you have to create a `useridentitymapping` to the existing identity:
+
----
$ oc create useridentitymapping htpasswd_provider:user99 user99
useridentitymapping.user.openshift.io/htpasswd_provider:user99 created
$ oc login -u user99
Authentication required for https://api.cluster-09ec.09ec.ocp4.opentlc.com:6443 (openshift)
Username: user99
Password:
Login successful.
----

Success!
